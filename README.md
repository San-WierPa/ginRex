# Welcome to ginRex's documentation!

Analyse program ... TODO

## Documentation
+ API documentation can be generated by using Sphinx. Build via
```
sphinx-build -b html doc/ doc/_build/html
```

## Git
+ ginRex is located on two repositories simultaneously. Pushing it to both requires following:<br>
For gitlab (main):
```
git remote set-url --add --push origin https://git.uni-wuppertal.de/ag-dlh/reflexafs-data-pipeline.git
```
For github (development):
```
git remote set-url --add --push origin https://github.com/San-WierPa/ginrex.git
```
Finally, git push (here: both branches are called development):
```
git push origin development
```
## Git lfs (large file storage)
+ Installation via
```
git lfs install
```
Tracking of files, which should be managed via Git lfs via:
```
git lfs track "*.fileformat"
```

**_NOTE:_**  ```cd large-file-directory``` and track.<br>
Make sure ```.gitattributes``` is tracked:
```
git add .gitattributes
```
**_Troubleshoot_** In case, git push origin development not works (or something went sideways while
dealing with two git's), just use
```
git push https://git.uni-wuppertal.de/ag-dlh/reflexafs-data-pipeline.git main
```


## Package build
+ Build all necessary packages that Python will require:
```
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```
 + Note for anaconda users: Correct environment needs to be activated.
