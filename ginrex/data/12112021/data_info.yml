            All measurements @ approximately 80 K.

            One data-sample: Scanzeit about 30 min. At the end of the spectrum multiple
            seconds integration-time (6 sec).
            A few spectras with similar energy-range. Integration-time/datapoint down to
            50 ms, 20 ms, 10 ms, and lastly 5 ms.

            Checking the quality:
            Signal/Noise-ratio and how this changes the quality of the EXAFS-fits.

            Any senseful data-results:
            For certain samples time-resolved experiments can be done.
